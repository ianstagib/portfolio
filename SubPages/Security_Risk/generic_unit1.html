									<b>Description</b>
									Unit 1 introduced core concepts in Security and Risk Management (SRM), focusing on definitions of risk, the relationship between threats and vulnerabilities, and the structure of the Risk Management Process (RMP). The lecturecast and readings examined qualitative and quantitative risk assessment approaches and outlined relevant standards, particularly ISO 31000 and ISO/IEC 27005. Formative activities included establishing a team project, agreeing a group contract, setting up the e-portfolio section, and preparing for seminar discussions.
									</p>
									<p>
									<b>Evaluation</b>
									The unit provided a clear conceptual foundation. Examining multiple definitions of risk revealed that the term is context-dependent rather than fixed. ISO 31000 defines risk as the “effect of uncertainty on objectives” (ISO, 2018), broadening the concept beyond probability and impact. In contrast, ISO/IEC 27005 situates risk within information security management systems (ISO, 2022). Understanding these differences clarified that framework selection must align with organisational context and purpose.

									The team project element was particularly valuable. We managed the project by separating tasks, and combined opinions in order to minimise the risk of any one individual being burdened by the work load and making the wrong decisions. It gave us an expanded shared knowledge to pool from.
									</p>
									<p>
									<b>Analysis</b>
									A key insight is that definitions shape practice. If risk is framed primarily as likelihood × impact, quantitative methods dominate. If viewed as uncertainty affecting objectives, broader contextual and governance considerations become central (Aven, 2016). Qualitative methods, such as risk matrices, support communication and accessibility but may oversimplify complexity. Quantitative approaches offer precision but depend on reliable data and sound assumptions.

									The RMP’s cyclical structure—identification, analysis, evaluation, treatment and monitoring—emphasises that risk management is continuous rather than a one-off compliance exercise (ISO, 2018). This iterative nature aligns with the dynamic threat landscape in security contexts.
									<p>
									<b>Conclusion and Action Plan</b>
									Unit 1 strengthened my understanding of risk definitions, assessment methods and standards selection. Moving forward, I intend to deepen my familiarity with ISO-based frameworks, practise applying both qualitative and quantitative techniques to scenarios, and integrate RMP principles into the team project. I will also maintain structured e-portfolio entries to connect theory with application.
